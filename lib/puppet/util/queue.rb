# Implements a message queue client type registry for use by the indirector facility.
# Client modules for speaking a particular protocol (e.g. Stomp::Client for Stomp message
# brokers, Memcached for Starling and Sparrow, etc.) register themselves with this module.
# 
# A given client class registers itself:
#   class Puppet::Indirector::Queue:SpecialMagicalClient < Messaging::SpecialMagic
#       ...
#   end
#   Puppet::Indirector::Queue::Client.register_queue_type_class(Puppet::Indirector::Queue::SpecialMagicalClient)
#
# This module reduces the rightmost segment of the class name into a pretty symbol that will
# serve as the queuing client's name.  Which means that the "SpecialMagicalClient" above will
# be named _:special_magical_client_ within the registry.
#
# Another class/module may mix-in this module, and may then make use of the registered clients.
#   class Queue::Fue
#       # mix it in at the class object level rather than instance level
#       extend ::Puppet::Util::Queue
#
#       # specify the default client type to use.
#       self.queue_type_default = :special_magical_type
#   end
#
# +Queue::Fue+ instances can get a message queue client through the registry through the mixed-in method
# +client+, which will return a class-wide singleton client instance, determined by +client_class+.
